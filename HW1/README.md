Student ID: 110550093

Name: 蔡師睿

## Introduction

The task involves image classification with 100 classes, covering both animals and plants. The dataset consists of 21,024 images for training and validation, and 2,344 images for testing. This challenge imposes several constraints: only the ResNet backbone is allowed, the model size must not exceed 100M, and the use of external data is prohibited.

## How to install

```bash
conda create -n hw1 python=3.10
conda activate hw1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
